# Database setup #
##################

# surveydown stores data on a database that you define at https://supabase.com/
# To connect to a database, update the sd_database() function with details
# from your supabase database. For this demo, we set ignore = TRUE, which will
# ignore the settings and won't attempt to connect to the database. This is
# helpful for local testing if you don't want to record testing data in the
# database table. See the documentation for details:
# https://surveydown.org/store-data

db <- sd_database(
  host   = "",
  dbname = "",
  port   = "",
  user   = "",
  table  = "",

# Welcome to our survey!

Here is a basic "multiple choice" question. The results will be displayed on the next page, showing both the choice you made as well as a summary of all the choices made by other participants.

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'penguins',
  label = "Which type of penguin do you like the best?",
  option = c(
    'AdÃ©lie'    = 'adelie',
    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',
    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'
  )
)
```
